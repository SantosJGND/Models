This repository contains scripts to faclitate simulations using the software SLiM, as well as scripts and notebooks to analyse the output. The objective of the project is to study selection. In order to achieve this goal a number of pre-requisites must be met. First, a pipeline of submission must be constructed and an adequate format decided on. Secondly, realistic simulations must be conducted within a demographic framework. We build up to that progressively. 

Each directory is concerned with some particular feature of simulations. These problems were tackled one at a time and each benefitted from lessons already learned, so that the functions overlap, and simulations become increasingly complete.

The directories are listed below, in order of chronological development, roughly in order of increasing complexity.

### OSG

Deployment to the Open Science Grid.

> [README.md](OSG/)


### ABC simulations.
Translating the demographic inferences of published deomographic models into simulation recipes.

> [README.md](/Bash)


### VCF sampling.

Extraction of windows in uniform format.
